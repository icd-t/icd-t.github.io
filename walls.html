        A collection of wallpapers made by me! You can also find the original redit post to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/wallpapers">r/wallpapers</a> and a download link under each wallpaper.
        Most of these will just be heavily edited photos from google to fit an overall aesthetic, but I think that we can agree that I still made them.

        I made this one after I watched the movie Drive. Kind of inspired by it, and the clothing brand <a href="https://www.machine56.com/">Machine 56</a>. Which is cyberpunk style.

        <br><br>
        This one I made for a previouse rendition of a website. All I did was put a random wallpaper through an Ascii art generator. Not a very complicated wallpaper, but it looks nice I guess.

        This one has my second logo on it, so I don't expect anyone to use it on their own computer. Overall this is the largest one I have ever made.

        I made this one after I saw the reveal traler for the new <a href="https://www.marathonthegame.com/">Marathon</a> game. The trailer had such a striking appearance, that I had to make a wallpaper out of it. I never actually used this one because I hate light mode wallpapers, but if you're into that sort of thing you can use it.

        <h2>Vapor Wave</h2>
        <img src="/walls/Vapor-Wave.png"><br>
        <span class="high"><a href="/walls/Vapor-Wave.png" download><i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Download</a></span>
        <span class="high"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/168f876/dark_mode_vaporwave_adjusted_4096x2160/">r/wallpapers</a></span>

        <br><br>
        This one's pretty self explanatory. I liked the vaporwave aesthetic at the time, but wanted something that was darkmode. Because everybody knows that darkmode is just plain better.

        <h2>Original Iced Tea Logo</h2>

        <br><br>
        These where made a few months after I made my original logo. Despite their obviouse flaws, I still like them to this day. I don't expect anyone else to use them due to my logo being plastered all across them.

        I created this one after seeing a wallpaper that I really liked, but was in really poor resolution. This was also my first venture into Inkscape. Its not very good, but who really cares.
