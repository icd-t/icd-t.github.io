    <h1>Euro Truck Simulator 2</h1>
    <p>
        A relaxing trucking simulator that seems strange at first but ropes you in with calm gameplay.

        You start as a trucker with no income and no truck, doing odd jobs for random companies. You slowly start earning money and eventually have enough to buy a truck, and then trailer. Then you start expanding your buisness and hiring employies untill you have a European shipping empire.

        The game was developed 12 years ago, and is easy to run on almost any PC. This sacrifices the uper end of graphical fidelity, however it still doesn't look terrible.
        <br>
        <br>
        The map includes the UK, Germany, and parts of France and Easter European Countries. The DLCs available expand upon this, and add nearly every European country in a 1:19 scale. If this is still not enough for you, try installing map mods such as the renowned ProMods, which adds over 80 more cities and 100s of roads.

        The modding community adds so much to the game, and over 12 years of mods only serves to increase this. The game is not for everyone, but for the right people its perfecct.

    <h2>Notes</h2>

        I made a company in the game, and I just thought that the branding I made for it was pretty good, so I wanted to share with y'all:
