                    Hello! My name is Iced Tea, or just ICDT for short. If you know me in real life, congradulations for stalking. I enjoy making these types of websites, I've been doing it since I was 10. Wlthough I have little experience with JS, I think this website turned out pretty well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adittionaly, I would like to give a huge thanks to osk for the inspiration for this websit. I also stole some of their css, so sorry about that in advance. You can check them out by going to their website at <a href="https://osk.sh">osk.sh</a>. Again, sorry for stealing your CSS...

                    Long ago, websites used to have buttons. These buttons were 88x31 pixel advertizements that attempted to get a click out of the user. Despite being advertizements they had lots of personality, and helped connect people across the decentralized inter-webs. Now, the only symbolance of this era is neocities. In order to keep this custom alive, I have created my own button. If you would like to put it on your website, just copy it from below!
                </p>
                <img alt="icd-t website button" src="imgs/icd-t.gif" class="pixel-img"><br>
                <img alt="icd-t website button" src="imgs/icd-t.gif" class="pixel-img" style="width: calc(20% + 88px);">
                <p>
                    Download my button by clicking here: <a href="imgs/icd-t.gif" download>Download</a>
