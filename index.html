        This is my website where I like to keep things I guess. Obviously my username is icd-t, because "Iced Tea" was taken. If you have any questions, please don't contact me. You can poke around if you want. There isn't really anything special here, just some things I find interesting. For now, here are some places you can go incase you're intersted: 

        <h2>Stuff</h2>

        <div class="parent"><a class="child" href="book.html">Book Reviews</a><div class="child" style="color: #555;"> Reviews I've made of some books or short stories I've read or listened to. Some of these wont even be full books, so I guess this is more of a story review.</div></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parent"><a class="child" href="game.html">Game Reviews</a><div class="child" style="color: #555;"> Reviews of games that I have played at some point. Most of them I hadn't finished at the time of the review.</div></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parent"><a class="child" href="">Thing Reviews</a><div class="child" style="color: #555;"> Reviews that don't fall into the first few catagories.</div></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parent"><a class="child" href="">Interesting Finds</a><div class="child" style="color: #555;"> Some things from accross the internet that I find interesting. Mainly stuff I care about for a week and then move on never to look back.</div></div>
        
        <h2>Other</h2>

        <div class="parent"><a class="child" href="versions.html">Version History</a><div class="child" style="color: #555;"> Previeous versions. Nothing much to it really.</div></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parent"><a class="child" href="">Contact</a><div class="child" style="color: #555;"> My socials and contacts. Don't use them unless you have a question. Actually, just don't use them at all.</div></div>
