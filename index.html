        This is my website where I like to keep things I guess. Obviously my username is icd-t, because "Iced Tea" was taken. If you have any questions, please don't contact me. You can poke around if you want. There isn't really anything special here, just some things I find interesting. For now, here are some places you can go in case you're intersted (Be warned, I am a terrible speller).
